        <h3 class="question">
          Could you tell me about yourself and describe your background in
          brief?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
          Talk about a relevant incident that made you keen on the profession
          you are pursuing and follow up by discussing your education. In the
          story, weave together how your academic training and your passion for
          the subject or industry the company specializes in, combined with your
          work experience, make you a great fit for the job. If you’ve managed a
          complex project or worked on an exciting, offbeat design, mention it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="question">What type of work environment do you prefer?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          Be sure to do your homework on the organization and its culture before
          the interview. Your research will save you here. Your preferred
          environment should closely align to the company’s workplace culture
          (and if it doesn’t, it may not be the right fit for you). For example,
          you may find on the company’s website that they have a flat
          organizational structure or that they prioritize collaboration and
          autonomy. Those are key words you can mention in your answer to this
          question.

      <div class="main-container">
        <h3 class="question">
          How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
          Share an instance when you remained calm despite the turmoil. If it’s
          a skill you’re developing, acknowledge that and include the steps
          you’re taking to respond better to pressure in the future. For
          example, you could indicate that you’ve started a mindfulness practice
          to help you better deal with stress.

      <div class="main-container">
        <h3 class="question">
          Do you prefer working independently or on a team?
        </h3>
        <p class="answer">
          Your answer should be informed by the research you’ve done on the
          company culture and the job in question. Nevertheless, you should
          expect that most work environments will have some team aspect.

        <h3 class="question">What are your salary expectations?</h3>
        <p class="answer">
          Before you walk in for your first interview, you should already know
          what the salary is for the position you’re applying to. Check out
          websites such as Glassdoor, Fishbowl, or Vault.com for salary
          information. You could also ask people in the field by reaching out to
          your community on LinkedIn.
